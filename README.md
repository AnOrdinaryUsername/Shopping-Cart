# Shopping-Cart

A fictional SaaS (SVGs as a Service) [site](https://anordinaryusername.github.io/Shopping-Cart/#/) that sells geometric SVGs. All SVGs, except the ones provided by FontAwesome, were made by me using Figma.

## Running it locally

Fork the repo and clone it with ssh

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:your-username/Shopping-Cart.git
```

Or https

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/Shopping-Cart.git
```

Change to the Shopping-Cart directory

```bash
> cd Shopping-Cart
```

### Using npm

In the repo folder run

```bash
> npm install
```

Then start up the dev server. It should automatically open [http://localhost:3000/Shopping-Cart](http://localhost:3000/Shopping-Cart) in your browser.

```bash
> npm start
```
